# Word List Randomizer

This program was originally made to get words randomly from text files to study Japanese. Feel free to use the current program or modify the code as you wish.

This code enables you to choose a file (.txt preferably) from the directory that the program is currently in and get lines from it at random.
The file can contain comments and they wont be in the output of the program.


Instructions:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the name of the file you want to use as your wordlist when prompted.
3. The program will display a randomly selected word or phrase from the file.
4. Press Enter to continue and see another random word.
5. [*CTRL+C*] to stop the program

Example of a file:
```
// A comment for the file
Apple
Banana   // This comment also works 
Orange
```
